The amazing landscape and the daffodil smell will make an unique experience from this trip. There are a couple of ways to get there (according to the group preference and weather): by car (~30min) followed by a 2 hour walk or by bike on the country road (~4h) – if you don't come with your own bike you can rent one from us.",
